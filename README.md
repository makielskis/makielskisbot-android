This wraps the botscript-service project into a fancy Android App.

When working with this project note that the botscript-service libary is located in the `jni/libs` directory.
The botscript-service libary must be compiled using the andorid-gcc toolchain provided in Googles Android NDK.
You will have to run the `ndk-build` command from the Android NDK in the project directory after updating the libary.
